# HexaEight Tokens Installable
This Repository contains the links to the Latest Release of HexaEight Tokens along with HexaEight Issued Certificates


### HexaEight Tokens is currently available for the following Platforms

[Windows (64 bit version)](https://www.hexaeight.com/downloads/win_x64/HexaEight_Token_Issuer_winx64.zip)

  The zip file contains an executable for Windows Platform. 
  You will also need to download the .hic file which is tied to this executable.
  
Linux (64 bit version)

Osx (64 bit version)

ARM (Raspberry pi version)


In order to run HexaEight Tokens on your machine you need a certficate file issued by HexaEight also known as HexaEight Issued Certificates (HIC)

### What Are HIC Files:

HexaEight Releases are NOT digitally signed using Code certificates.  As such they may be prone to modifications.  Hence we have introduced HexaEight Certificates which are a alternative to Code signing certificates for quick verification.

HexaEight Issued Certificates uses Authenticated Encryption Technlogy to establish the authenticty of the Executable. While HexaEight Issed Certificates DOES NOT prevent an attacker from tampering with the executable, it does help in verifying the AUTHENTICITY of executable prior to execution.

NOTE: HexaEight Executables protected by HIC are not allowed to change the name of the executable under normal conditions, the executable wont run if the name of the executable is changed.

### Sample output of the executable.

 ### How to verify the AUTHENTICITY of the executable ?
 
 We are still in the stages of making this process easier, but at the moment, there are two ways to verify the authenticty of the executables present in the downloaded zip file
 
### METHOD 1: The old fashioned way of validting the hash manully without the HIC file. 
 
a) Get the Hash of the Executable File using a tool or use powershell commannd 
    
```
PS C:\tokens> Get-FileHash .\HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe -Algorithm SHA512 | Format-List

Algorithm : SHA512
Hash      : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Path      : C:\tokens\HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe
```

b) Get the Version Propeties of the Executable file by using the following command
    
```
PS C:\tokens> Get-ItemProperty .\HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe |  Format-list -Property VersionInfo

VersionInfo : File:             C:\Data\tokens\HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe
              InternalName:     HexaEight_Token_Issuer.dll
              OriginalFilename: HexaEight_Token_Issuer.dll
              FileVersion:      1.6.801.0
              FileDescription:  HexaEight_Token_Issuer
              Product:          HexaEight Token Issuer Service
              ProductVersion:   1.6.801
              Debug:            False
              Patched:          False
              PreRelease:       False
              PrivateBuild:     False
              SpecialBuild:     False
              Language:         Language Neutral
```

In order to verify the hash, you need to take four properties from the file: 

1. File name of Executable : HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe
2. File Hash of Executable : (whatever was obtained in step 1) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx
3. Product shown in Version info followed by a space and Fileversion: HexaEight Token Issuer Service 1.6.801.0

HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe213176019588..................CB106370BHexaEight Token Issuer Service 1.6.801.0

There should be no leading or trailing spaces. Paste this in an online tool https://sha512.online/ and click on the generate hash button. You will see a generated  hash that should match with the below VerifiedHash shown below. If the hash matches, the executable is safe.

```

FileName : HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe
VerifiedHash : 1f2852c24b839ed7e98bdc74062111a48f734edcec3b48551c620bc7bee8b6bbd64cee1a074e2b8fb82b2b509504c223fa7fc67b3fb6f26090ffe4ccef6662b8

Certificate Issued At : 27499997
Certificate Expiry At : 27759195
AuthenticData : This File or Sofware [HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe] has been verified successfully.

The Hash can also be manually verified by combining the following properties below:
FILENAME followed By HASHOFTHISFILE followed by DESCRIPTION
The above SHA512 Hash should match with 1f2852c24b839ed7e98bdc74062111a48f734edcec3b48551c620bc7bee8b6bbd64cee1a074e2b8fb82b2b509504c223fa7fc67b3fb6f26090ffe4ccef6662b8

```

### METHOD 2: Run the program with the verifycert option to validate the executable using the HIC file.

You should see a message that contains the authenticated encrypted information from the HIC file which was decrypted using the Hash of the File which would prove the authenticity of the executable.

c:\tokens>HexaEight_Token_Issuer.exe --verifycert

### Method 3: A Web page that allows you to verify the authenticity of the Executable is still in progress. We will update the information once its ready.
